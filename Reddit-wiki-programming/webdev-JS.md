# Resources To Learn  Web Development in Javascript

Before i begin writing this, you need to understand the concept of feedback loops. There are an infinite amount of free tutorials/ bootcamps, 
but they are not producing the same amount of good development engineers. Its really important to understand why.

You cannot learn something just by imitating or rote learning syntax. You have to apply everything in as many different permutations and combinations as possible. 
You all must have witnessed the anomaly of people landing amazing job without having a crazy amount of skills.

Here's the secret:
" Do less, but do it amazingly well."

Even if you just learn HTML & CSS, practice making enough mockups that you are really good at HTML & CSS. Creating feedbacks loops for yourself by challenging
yourself to make fully functional apps out of a requirement/feature list is the only way to get better at this. The geeks call this a top down approach.

Trust me on this, knowing 100 programming languges will not set you apart, but building something extremely useful from something as bad as PHP is enough to land you a good job!
So please focus on that instead of doing a tutorial rampage.

I will include feedback loop sessions which will allow you to test your skills.

Consider them like scenarios where you try to reapeat an answer you memorized without seeing to check whether it has been registered in your head properly.
To do the above mentioned things better I recommend you to watch the below videos:
